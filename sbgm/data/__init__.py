"""Datasets for sbgm.

This package contains data loading utilities for both 2D image
datasets (e.g. MNIST) and oneâ€‘dimensional time series. Synthetic
datasets are also provided. Each submodule exposes functions or
classes returning PyTorch ``Dataset`` objects and corresponding
``DataLoader`` factory functions when appropriate.
